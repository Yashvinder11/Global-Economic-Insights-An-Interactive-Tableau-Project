This project aims to provide an interactive analysis of global economic trends using Tableau. It explores key economic indicators such as GDP, GNI, global trade balances, sectoral contributions to GDP, population metrics, and exchange rate comparisons. The dashboards are designed to help policymakers, analysts, and stakeholders understand macroeconomic trends and identify actionable insights.
